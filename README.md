## Development

To build the blocks integration:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the assets:
```bash
npm run build
```

For development, you can use:
```bash
npm run start
```
```

The key changes in this update are:

1. Added support for WooCommerce Blocks API through a new `LNbitsPaymentMethod` class
2. Created a React component for the checkout block interface
3. Set up the necessary build process for JavaScript assets
4. Maintained compatibility with the existing classic checkout while adding support for the new blocks checkout

To implement this update:

1. Create the directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p blocks/src blocks/build
```

2. Create all the files mentioned above
3. Install the Node.js dependencies
4. Build the JavaScript assets
5. Test the integration in both classic and block-based checkout pages

The updated plugin will now work with both:
- Classic WooCommerce checkout
- New WooCommerce Blocks checkout

The payment flow remains the same, but the integration is now compatible with the modern block-based checkout experience. The plugin will continue to:
1. Create a SatsPay charge when an order is placed
2. Redirect to the LNbits payment page
3. Handle payment confirmation through webhooks
